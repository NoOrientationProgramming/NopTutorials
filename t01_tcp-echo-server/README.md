## Introduction

TODO
- Program is a sequence of commands
- Early days: Just functions
- Now: Two more cases
  - Tasks with high CPU load
  - Network and communication
- What is a function?
  - Math: y = f(x)
  - Software (Stack)
- What is a process?
  - Math: y = p(x, t)
  - Software (Heap)
- The (abstract) C++ class Processing() implements the general behavior of a process
- All specific processes are derived from the abstract base class Processing()
  - Reducing the class diagram to a minimum
  - Information about the system structure is shown as a graph now
